Hello! This is my program to download Youtube, Instagram and TikTok videos.
Version 0.1

Because Google did something with Youtube now pytube is broken.
pytubefix was made to fix issues but still downloaded video above
360p have no sound. Tried many things but non of them works
(if you know the fix plz mgs me) so decided to add option to download
hi res video. Program will download best video quality and best
audio quality and merge them together to make video. Problem 
with this is that merging take a while to do.
